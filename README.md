# libgotftp


## About

`libgotftp` is a TFTP library for go lang. Originally written by [Esa-Matti Suuronen](https://esamatti.fi) for hooktftp. We decided
to split library into new repository to be able to use package into other projects.


## TODO

  * Improvement: Define feature set with TFTP RFCs references
  * Feature: Unit-test for Transfer Size option
  * Feature: Timeout Interval option (RFC2349)
